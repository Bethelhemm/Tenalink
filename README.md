# Blockchain-Based Public Healthcare & Medical Records System

## Overview
A **Blockchain-Based Public Healthcare & Medical Records System** is a decentralized solution designed to improve healthcare infrastructure, securely store patient records, and enhance accessibility to medical history. This system leverages Solana's high-speed and low-cost blockchain network, built using Rust, to ensure data integrity, privacy, and secure sharing of medical information among authorized healthcare providers.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: Medical records are securely stored and accessed on the blockchain.
- **Privacy & Security**: Patient data is encrypted, ensuring only authorized access.
- **Interoperability**: Enables seamless sharing of medical history among hospitals and healthcare providers.
- **Immutable Records**: Prevents unauthorized tampering and ensures data integrity.
- **Fast & Cost-Efficient**: Utilizes Solanaâ€™s high-performance blockchain for real-time data access with low transaction costs.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Patients, doctors, and hospitals have different permission levels.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain Platform**: Solana
- **Programming Language**: Rust
- **Smart Contracts**: Solana Program Library (SPL)
- **Database**: Decentralized storage solutions (IPFS or Arweave)
- **Authentication**: Public and private key cryptography

## Installation & Setup
